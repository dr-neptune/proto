- get a basic scaffold working for clojure / cljs

** Idea
make a simple brownian motion plotter in which the user can interact
with the parameters and show it on the frontend. Maybe we can add
plots / controls / etc?

Would this be better to contain entirely on the frontend? Split across
front and backend? Should we start setting up a layered architecture
for the app? How do namespaces work in clojure?
