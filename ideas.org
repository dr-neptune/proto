- get a basic scaffold working for clojure / cljs

** Idea
make a simple brownian motion plotter in which the user can interact
with the parameters and show it on the frontend. Maybe we can add
plots / controls / etc?

Would this be better to contain entirely on the frontend? Split across
front and backend? Should we start setting up a layered architecture
for the app? How do namespaces work in clojure?

** Idea
Let's make something fun related to quantitative finance

A user can have strategies
- each strategy can have data sources
- with said data sources, a model can be fit
- with each model, the user can store backtest results

Let's keep it simple for now. This is mainly to build up the front and
backend and to introduce a database.
